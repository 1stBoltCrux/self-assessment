## Ted Leary's Self Assessment ##

#### Is there anything about the general job search and internship interview process you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in your job search and internship interviews? ####

* My only general anxiety about the job application and interview process is that I am relying more or less solely on Epicodus for my technical background. Some of our Wednesday speakers have mentioned coming into the programming world with little to no experience though and obviously they made it work, so that gives me confidence.
  I think what would make me more confident in the job search and internship interviews is a more concrete grasp of computer science concepts and an "ordering" of knowledge in my head. I feel that I've learned so much so fast that it can be difficult to articulate a concept in a way that makes sense to others. I know generally what it does, but can I explain it in a way that is clear and concise? Not as frequently as I'd like.

#### Is there anything about searching for and transitioning into your future career a technical field that you feel unprepared for? What would make you feel more comfortable and confident in this process? ####

* I feel a little unprepared in regards to the mathematics inherent in programming. I have a pretty lousy math background and math concepts don't come easy. I think if I spend some time doing Khan Academy courses as well as continue with more algorithm practice in JavaScript I'd feel more confident. Aside from that I'm more excited than anxious.



## The Plan ##

1. Go over the interview questions section of Learnhowtoprogram.com and answer them to the best of my ability in a google doc. Turn the information from this doc into a flashcard app in React.
2. Make time to do JavaScript algorithm challenges on freecode.camp or another similar site.
3. Finish my portfolio website in React.
4. Brush up on math concepts at Khan Academy.
5. Continue focusing on React and solidifying my understanding of its function.
